Introduction  
Indonesia, an archipelago rich in cultural diversity, is also known for its rich 
variety of herbs and their use in traditional medicine for centuries. One of the most 
famous cultural heritages is jamu, which is a system of herbal medicine that has been 
used since the days of the kingdoms in the archipelago. Jamu is not just an herbal drink, 
but an integral part of Indonesian life, symbolizing local wisdom in maintaining health. 
The use of herbal medicine in Indonesia has a long and rich history, reflecting the 
local wisdom and traditions of the community in utilizing nature for health (Widowati et 
al., 2012). The history of herbal medicine can be traced back to the period of the 
Nusantara kingdoms, with the first written evidence of its use coming from inscriptions 
and ancient manuscripts, such as Serat Centhini written in the early 19th century, 
although the practice is believed to have started much earlier (Maryani et al., 2016). In 
old manuscripts and historical records, jamu is described as an heirloom of civilization, 
used for generations for a variety of purposes, ranging from disease treatment, daily 
health maintenance, to beauty and spiritual rituals (Widowati et al., 2014). The practice 
of using jamu indicates an extraordinary level of recognition and utilization of 
Indonesia's rich flora for health, as well as demonstrating the expertise of ancestors in 
selecting and processing natural ingredients (Kusuma et al., 2020). 
However, the history of herbal medicine is also full of challenges, especially 
amidst the penetration of modern medicine and the global pharmaceutical industry. 
Issues of safety, standardization, and scientific validation are important topics in the 
discourse on the use of herbal medicine in the modern era (Sahumena et al., 2020). 

297 
 
Questions about the efficacy and consistent quality of herbal medicine are often raised, 
triggering a debate between traditional versus modern medicine. Along with 
globalization and scientific advances, the public began to demand strong scientific 
evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of herbal medicine (Kamar et al., 2021). This 
has forced researchers, practitioners, and the Indonesian government to take research, 
development, and regulation more seriously to support the recognition of herbal 
medicine as an important part of the health system, and to preserve it as a cultural 
heritage that not only has historical value, but also great economic and health potential 
for Indonesia (Harimurti et al., 2020). 
From the time of the Nusantara kingdoms to the modern era, the development 
of herbal medicine has undergone various significant transformations, both in terms of 
production, composition, and how it is used. In the past, jamu was traditionally made by 
herbalists from natural ingredients gathered from the surrounding nature. Herbal 
recipes were passed down orally from generation to generation, making them an 
important part of cultural heritage (Aditama, 2014). In the royal era, herbalists even had 
an important role at court, responsible for the health of the king and his family. Along 
with the changing times, knowledge about jamu began to be documented in various 
manuscripts and inscriptions, expanding its spread in society (Purwaningsih, 2013). 
The introduction of colonial influences and the development of modern science 
brought about major changes in the practice of traditional medicine, including jamu. The 
jamu industry began to emerge in the early 20th century, making jamu production no 
longer limited to a home scale but also a larger industrial scale (Satriyati, 2017). In the 
modern era, herbal medicine is not only consumed in its traditional form, but has also 
been adapted into various product forms, such as tablets, capsules, and powders, which 
are more practical for consumption. Government regulations and scientific research on 
herbal medicine are also increasingly intense to answer the challenges of safety, 
efficacy, and standardization (Ramadhan et al., 2022).  Today, herbal medicine has 
become part of the health industry integrated with the modern medical system, proving 
its resilience and adaptability to the changing times, while bringing tremendous 
influence to the preservation and development of traditional medicine in Indonesia 
(Mustofa et al., 2022). 
Finally, the existence of jamu as part of traditional medicine has persisted and 
even grown in popularity. Its distinctive uniqueness, which combines elements of 
culture, tradition, and science about the natural healing properties of various plants, 
makes herbal medicine have a special place in the hearts of its people (Supardi et al., 
2011). 
However, in reality, herbal medicine and other traditional medicines still face 
various challenges, including in terms of scientific recognition, standardization, safety, 
and efficacy. On the one hand, increased awareness of healthy lifestyles and a return to 
nature is driving increased demand for natural products, including herbal medicine 

298 
 
(Gitawati & Widowati, 2015). On the other hand, there are still doubts among some 
people regarding its efficacy and safety compared to modern pharmaceutical drugs 
(Pratama, 2022). 
The question of how to integrate jamu with the modern health system, how to 
improve research and development, and how to utilize the potential of jamu for the 
health and welfare of the community, is very relevant (Agustina, 2006); (Mahawikan et 
al., 2022). Therefore, it is important to conduct an in-depth study of the role and 
existence of herbal medicine in traditional medicine in Indonesia, with the hope of 
providing useful information for the development of strategies for the preservation and 
integration of herbal medicine in the national health system. 
This study is expected to provide a clear picture of the position of herbal 
medicine in the modern era, identify challenges and barriers, and propose appropriate 
solutions to ensure that herbal medicine can continue to be an important part of 
Indonesia's cultural heritage and treatment system, while ensuring its safety, 
effectiveness, and quality. 
 
Research Method 
The study in this research uses a literature review. The literature research 
method is a technique in research studies that focuses on collecting data from various 
published sources, such as books, scientific journal articles, conference proceedings, 
theses, and the like (Sio et al., 2024; Nguyen et al., 2024). In conducting the literature 
study method, the first step is to search for relevant keywords in catalogs, indexes, and 
search engines to identify materials that match the research topic (Kim et al., 2024; 
Nesset et al., 2024). After that, the data collection process involves reading and 
recording important information generated from various literatures related to the 
specific research objectives. 
 
Result and Discussion 
Definition of Herbs 
Jamu is a traditional Indonesian medicine system rooted in the ancient Javanese 
cultural heritage, although similar practices are also found in other parts of Indonesia 
(Widowati et al., 2014). The word 'jamu' itself comes from the Old Javanese language 
meaning 'herbs' (Maryani et al., 2016). The definition of jamu refers to a combination of 
various natural ingredients, mainly plants, used to promote health, prevent, or treat 
disease. These herbal mixtures are usually consumed in the form of drinks or powders 
and have evolved over generations with recipes adapted through empirical experience 
and adjustments to local conditions (Kusuma et al., 2020). Jamu not only reflects 
Indonesia's rich biodiversity but also a holistic philosophy of health, involving physical 
and spiritual balance (Sahumena et al., 2020). 

299 
 
Jamu can be classified based on its intended use into several main types, 
including jamu for maintaining health and vitality, jamu for treating specific diseases, 
jamu for beauty, and jamu for reproductive health. Each of these categories includes a 
variety of recipes designed to meet different health needs (Kamar et al., 2021). In terms 
of form, traditional herbs are usually presented in liquid form, such as brewed herbs or 
drunk fresh, but in modern times, herbs have also adapted to other more practical 
forms, including tablets, capsules, powders, and even in the form of ready-to-brew tea 
(Harimurti et al., 2020). These developments not only make jamu easier to consume by 
various groups of people but also help preserve and popularize the use of jamu as part 
of a healthy lifestyle to the international arena (Aditama, 2014). 
Furthermore, Indonesian traditional herbal medicine has undergone innovation 
and standardization to meet modern health standards and market requirements. This 
includes in-depth scientific research to validate the efficacy of herbal components used 
in jamu as well as the development of hygienic and sustainable production methods 
(Purwaningsih, 2013). In the era of globalization, jamu is not only limited to users in 
Indonesia, but has also attracted interest in the global market as a natural therapeutic 
alternative (Satriyati, 2017). 
Thus, jamu is an Indonesian cultural heritage that has developed from generation 
to generation with efficacy recognized for generations. Today, jamu not only survives 
through its traditional values, but is also integrated with modern science to improve 
quality and competitiveness. By combining traditional health principles with 
contemporary production methods, jamu remains relevant and continues to play an 
important part of the complementary and alternative health system in Indonesia and 
around the world. 
 
Traditional Medicine 
Traditional medicine in Indonesia relies on a deep understanding of the balance 
between body, mind and environment, which is often closely linked to spiritual values 
and local customs (Kassaye et al., 2006). This concept reflects human interaction with 
nature and the belief that nature provides the necessary resources to heal and maintain 
health. Natural ingredients such as herbs, spices and roots are processed according to 
traditional recipes and are believed to have special properties to treat various health 
problems (Mukherjee, 2001). This holistic concept is supported by medicinal practices 
that focus not only on curing physical ailments but also on balancing energy in the body 
and restoring psychological and spiritual health, reflecting the view that optimal health 
is harmony between all aspects of life (Kayne, 2009). Traditional medicine, therefore, is 
not just about consuming jamu, but also involves massage therapy, meditation, rites, 
and sometimes energy healing, all of which are an integral part of local wisdom in 
various tribes and communities in Indonesia (Lu et al., 2021).

Traditional medicine and modern medicine have fundamental differences in 
treatment approaches, methodologies and philosophies. Traditional medicine focuses 
on the use of natural materials, such as herbs and spices, and often considers harmony 
between the physical, mental and spiritual in the healing process, viewing the body as a 
unity that needs to be kept in balance (Arnold & Gulumian, 1984). This approach is 
usually holistic, with an emphasis on prevention and treatment that adapts to individual 
conditions. In contrast, modern medicine, often associated with western medicine, is 
based on science and technology, using synthetic drugs, medical procedures, and 
sophisticated equipment in diagnosis and therapy (Sofowora, 1996). Modern medicine 
tends to be specific and segmented in dealing with illness, with a primary focus on 
treating physical illnesses and their symptoms, often through direct intervention at the 
source of the problem (Payyappallimana, 2010). A clear difference between the two 
systems is also seen in the way treatment efficacy is validated, where modern medicine 
requires rigorous clinical trials, whereas traditional medicine relies more on hereditary 
knowledge and empirical experience (Waldram, 2000). 
Thus, traditional medicine and modern medicine are two different but 
complementary systems in promoting health and healing. Traditional medicine is based 
on hereditary knowledge and utilization of natural materials with a holistic approach, 
while modern medicine relies on scientific evidence, advanced technology, and disease-
specific interventions. While the methods and principles between the two can vary, 
both play an important role in offering therapeutic options for people, with traditional 
medicine often considered as a companion or alternative to modern medicine, 
especially in the context of complementary and integrative medicine. 
 
Discussion on Herbal Ingredients 
Herbal ingredients used in making jamu include a variety of plants known to have 
medicinal properties, such as temulawak (Curcuma xanthorrhiza) to improve liver 
function, turmeric (Curcuma longa) which functions as an anti-inflammatory and boosts 
the immune system, ginger (Zingiber officinale) which is effective in relieving colds and 
indigestion, and lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) which is often used for relaxation 
and calming the mind (Organization, 2013). Others include cinnamon (Cinnamomum 
verum) which helps control blood sugar levels, galangal (Alpinia galanga) which has 
anti-inflammatory properties, and cat's whisker leaves (Orthosiphon stamineus) which 
are known to be good for kidney health. These ingredients are usually processed 
traditionally through boiling or shredded into powder, then mixed according to 
hereditary recipes to create jamu with specific functions according to their medicinal 
needs (Houghton, 1995). 
The processing and preparation of herbal ingredients in traditional herbal 
medicine involves several important steps to ensure the maximum efficacy of the 
ingredients (Yuan et al., 2016). Typically, fresh herbal ingredients are first cleaned to 

301 
 
remove impurities and residues. According to the herbal recipe, the ingredients are then 
chopped, ground, or pulverized using traditional tools such as stone cobblers or modern 
blenders to achieve effective extraction (Che et al., 2017). Boiling is often used to extract 
active compounds from herbal ingredients, where the water used and the duration of 
boiling are regulated to ensure a rich extract. Alternatively, fermentation or filtration is 
also used in some herbs to improve the bioavailability and absorption of active 
ingredients (Vecchiato, 2019). After the extraction process is complete, the herbs are 
filtered to separate the pulp from the liquid, which can then be directly consumed or 
further processed, such as thickening or drying into powder form. Cleanliness and 
thoroughness in each stage of processing are very important to maintain the quality and 
effectiveness of the herbal medicine produced (Sindiga et al., 1995). 
In conclusion, the processing and preparation methods of herbal ingredients in 
herbal medicine include a series of meticulous and hygienic processes, from cleaning, 
cutting, grinding to boiling or fermentation, all aimed at optimizing the extraction of the 
properties of the natural ingredients. This process is crucial to ensure that the herbs are 
not only effective in providing the desired health benefits, but also safe for 
consumption. Through traditional methods that have been passed down through 
generations or the use of modern techniques, this meticulous processing helps in 
maintaining the integrity and potency of the herbal ingredients in jamu, a reflection of 
local wisdom in utilizing nature's bounty for health. 
 
Efficacy and Benefits of Herbs 
The effectiveness of jamu as medicine has been recognized throughout history 
in various communities, especially in Indonesia, thanks to its blend of natural herbal 
ingredients rich in bioactive compounds (Gitawati & Widowati, 2015). Over time, 
scientific research has begun to uncover the mechanisms by which these ingredients 
work in the body, showing potential as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic and 
antimicrobial, among others. However, the specific effectiveness of herbal medicine 
depends on many factors, including the quality of the raw materials, the precision in 
processing, and the dosage used. While many users report direct benefits of jamu 
consumption in the management of various health conditions, further clinical studies 
are needed to broadly support such claims (Maryani et al., 2016). Therefore, the use of 
jamu as complementary medicine in modern medicine is gaining attention as an 
important area of research, promising the integration of traditional wisdom and 
modern science for holistic health management. 
The diversity of benefits offered by jamu is tailored to the composition of herbal 
ingredients used in the recipe, resulting in various types of jamu with specific health 
focuses (Kusuma et al., 2020). Herbs based on turmeric and ginger can help improve 
digestive health and protect the liver, while herbs containing ginger are known for their 
effectiveness in relieving colds and stimulating blood circulation (Sahumena et al., 

302 
 
2020). Herbs infused with moringa or gotu kola are often used to help strengthen the 
immune system and aid cognitive function, while herbs with cardamom or cinnamon 
may be targeted to alleviate digestive problems or control blood sugar levels (Kamar et 
al., 2021). There are also specialty herbs for women, blended from herbs such as 
turmeric and manjakani, designed to address feminine issues and improve reproductive 
health (Harimurti et al., 2020). The variety of benefits makes jamu not only a healing 
medicine but also a health supplement to prevent various diseases, all of which reflect 
the holistic philosophy of traditional medicine in maintaining the balance and harmony 
of the body (Aditama, 2014). 
The conclusion that can be drawn from the discussion of jamu is that jamu is not 
just a traditional herbal drink, but is part of a holistic treatment system that has a 
diversity of health benefits thanks to the combination of natural ingredients. Each type 
of jamu is formulated with specific recipes to target specific health conditions, 
encapsulating the traditional wisdom of utilizing nature's bounty for physical and 
mental well-being. Jamu offers potential as complementary medicine in support of 
modern medicine, with further studies conducted to validate its effectiveness and 
mechanism of action. This affirms jamu's position as a valuable cultural heritage, while 
encouraging the integration of tradition and modern science in the pursuit of holistic 
health improvement. 
 
Herbs and Health Practices 
In the traditional health care system, jamu plays a significant role as an 
alternative treatment method that relies on hereditary knowledge and utilization of 
natural resources (Purwaningsih, 2013). As an integral part of health practices in 
Indonesia and several other countries, jamu is not only considered as a medicine to treat 
various diseases, but also as a way to maintain health and prevent disease (Satriyati, 
2017). Traditional health workers such as shamans, healers, or herbalists often make 
herbal medicine the first choice in their therapy, based on the philosophy of body 
balance and harmony (Ramadhan et al., 2022). The acceptance and integration of herbal 
medicine in the healthcare system reflects recognition of the value and effectiveness of 
herbal therapies, while encouraging the development of more evidence-based 
practices, education on safe use, and standardization in production and distribution to 
maintain the quality and safety of herbal medicine (Mustofa et al., 2022). 
The integration of herbal medicine with modern medicine is a progressive step 
that combines the richness of traditional medicine with scientific accuracy. In some 
regions, such as Indonesia, this integration effort has begun with the standardization of 
herbal medicine production in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) 
principles and research to prove the efficacy and safety of herbal components against 
various health conditions (Supardi et al., 2011). The modern health system has gradually 
recognized the potential of herbal medicine as a complementary and alternative 

303 
 
approach, where herbal medicine is not only used as an adjuvant to improve the results 
of conventional treatment but also as the main therapeutic option in certain cases 
(Gitawati & Widowati, 2015). This creates a synergy between the two systems, where 
ethnobotanical knowledge and traditional practices are valued along with the 
application of scientific approaches supported by growing clinical evidence, making 
treatment more holistic and individualized in improving the quality of patients' health. 
 
The Existence of Herbal Medicine in the Modern Era 
Public Acceptance 
Public acceptance of jamu is still strong, especially in countries with a cultural 
heritage of herbal medicine such as Indonesia, where jamu is not only valued as part of 
cultural identity but also trusted for daily health (Pratama, 2022). Despite the increasing 
trend towards modern medicine, many individuals continue to choose jamu for 
economic reasons, local availability, and belief in its natural benefits and fewer side 
effects (Agustina, 2006). This is reinforced by the growing awareness of healthy 
lifestyles and a return to nature, which has encouraged younger generations to be more 
accepting and even promote jamu as a healthy option. This trust continues to grow in 
line with improvements in the quality and standardization of herbal medicine as well as 
the publication of scientific research that confirms its effectiveness, so that the 
acceptance of herbal medicine in society reaches a balance between local wisdom and 
scientific validation (Mahawikan et al., 2022). 
The popularity of herbal medicine is not limited to rural communities but is also 
widespread in urban areas, where lifestyle shifts and health awareness have driven 
increased interest in this herbal medicine (Fatmawati & Wijaya, 2021). In big cities, jamu 
has undergone a transformation in both presentation and presentation, with availability 
in modern and convenient packaging appealing to young consumers and busy 
professionals. Nonetheless, in rural areas, jamu is still deeply rooted in tradition and 
often prepared in traditional ways directly from fresh ingredients (Zulkarnain et al., 
2019). This positive trend shows how jamu has managed to bridge the gap between 
traditional and modern, maintaining its relevance in a diverse society. Online availability 
and promotion through social media has further expanded the reach of jamu, affirming 
its position as a dynamic and adaptive piece of cultural heritage that has managed to 
survive and thrive in the globalization era (Andriati & Wahjudi, 2016). 
Social media and effective marketing strategies have played an important role in 
maintaining and enhancing the presence of jamu in the digital era (Abdullahi, 2011). 
Through social media platforms, jamu producers and enthusiasts can share information 
on health benefits, recipes, and proper usage, while creating awareness and building a 
wide community of users. Digital marketing also allows herbal medicine to reach a 
younger and urbanized audience, who may have previously had less exposure to herbal 
medicine traditions (Zhang, 2004). With engaging and educational content, jamu is 

304 
 
successfully positioned as a trendy and relevant natural health solution. Marketing 
campaigns that utilize influencers and public figures to endorse modern herbal products 
have increased their popularity among more brand- and lifestyle-conscious consumers 
(Igoli et al., 2005). Thus, social media and marketing have not only helped in maintaining 
the existence of herbal medicine but also in redefining people's perception of herbal 
medicine, making it more appealing and accessible to different walks of life. 
 
Conclusion 
Recent research findings indicate that jamu plays a crucial role in both traditional 
and modern medicine schemes, thanks to its efficacy and potency supported by 
scientific evidence. This review highlights how jamu has not only maintained its 
existence as an important element of cultural heritage in its countries of origin, such as 
Indonesia, but also how it has gained global recognition as a safe and natural 
therapeutic alternative. The findings show a positive shift in public perception, from a 
mere home remedy to a health product backed by scientific research. Research into the 
chemical composition, therapeutic potential and mechanism of action of jamu 
strengthens its position in integrative medicine. This, together with the strategic use of 
social media and marketing, has contributed to the increasing popularity of jamu not 
only among traditional but also urbanized communities, demonstrating its adaptability 
and resilience in the face of social change and technological advancement. 
The future of jamu in medicine in Indonesia seems very promising, in line with 
the increasing global awareness of holistic health and natural medicine. With more 
research supporting the health benefits of jamu and recognition from the medical 
community, jamu is expected to be increasingly integrated into the formal health 
system. We may see closer collaboration between traditional and modern medicine 
practitioners, where standardized and scientifically researched jamu recipes become a 
companion or alternative to conventional medicine. Clear regulations and consistent 
standardization are needed to ensure the quality and safety of herbal medicine, which 
will increase public trust and facilitate its integration into official medicine. With its rich 
culture and biodiversity, Indonesia has great potential to become a global leader in the 
development and promotion of traditional medicine, especially herbal medicine, which 
brings benefits to the health of mankind in a broad and sustainable manner.
